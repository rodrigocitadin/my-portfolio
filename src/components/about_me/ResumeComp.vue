    <p class="text">
      Self-taught in technology. I've been studying backend development for 6 months now. I always seek
      to bring quality to my applications, with the best methodologies, technologies and metrics, bringing a final
      product of value and maintainability.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
      I'm a type systems enthusiast. My favorite technologies Rust and Typescript, but I also have skills in Javascript,
      NodeJS, ExpressJS and VueJS. In databases, I have knowledge in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
    </p>
    <p class="text">

      I'm looking for my first job opportunity. I'm sure I'm prepared for whatever it takes, and if I don't know some
      necessary technology, I can learn easily and quickly.
